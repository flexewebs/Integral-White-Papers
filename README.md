# Superhuman Manifesto

Superhuman manifesto defines superhumans characteristics. Manifesto's aim is to inspire. It's a guide for an upgraded way to be, do and have.

# Be

## Superhumans are superabundant
At any stage in their lives, superhumans know they live in superabundace. They are aware of direct access to resources. Their superabundance starts in the mind. It reflects in doing and having. In that order. Superhuman abundant physical life is a direct results of mental superabundance.

## Superhumans are polymaths
Interest in many subjects is the norm for superhumans. They synthesise across varied realms. They aim to realise broader truth. They embrace tendency to like many themes. They utilise plethora of different skills. They always work on expanding their capabilities across the board.

## Superhumans are neutral
Inner balance is the most natural state of being. Superhumans realise this and keep their inner balance at all times. From this state they can do and have balanced outcomes in life. Outcomes which have long term relevance. 

## Superhumans are blissful 
Blissfulness is a byproduct of enlightenment. Realising the perfection of creation produces blissfulness in all situations. Superhumans are blissful because of the awareness level they are at. 

## Superhumans are complete
Superhumans feel complete inside. They don't need anything. They are able to survive no matter what. They still upgrade their approach to life. They know their potential. They use time to realise that potential. 

## Superhumans are prophetic 
Superhumans know that words create worlds. They are care-full about what they speak into reality. What superhumans talk about, becomes reality.  Superhuman approach to life means that their verbal predictions become prophetic. This is because superhumans put their own words into practice.

## Superhumans know
Superhumans gain knowledge all the time. Knowledge is power. Continuous gaining of knowledge is a continuous gaining of power. Superhumans first know themselves. They then integrate all kinds of other knowledge throughout their lives. They also share their knowledge with the rest of humanity. 

## Superhumans prioritise doing over talking 
Words create worlds. It requires doing for verbal intentions to reflect themselves in reality. This is why superhumans prioritise doing over talking. Reflections in reality are more valuable than conceptions in language. 

## Superhumans are strategic
Long term approach is the key to being superhuman. Ten, twenty, thirty or hundred year visions and plans are normal. You can only connect the dots backwards. Start with the end vision. Then connect the dots backwards to present moment. Then act on the outlined strategy. 

## Superhumans are systematic
A complete approach to life and understanding of how things work is a requisite. Superhumans understand the systemic nature of everything. They are systems thinkers and comprehend complexity very well. They are able to design and change systems for the better. 

## Superhumans are peaceful 
Inner peace produces peace on Earth. Superhumans understand that peace is the most natural way to be. Superhumans are always peaceful. Even if that peacefulness requires them to self-protect. Superhumans will never start a fight first. This is in line with teachings and ethos of all martial arts. 

## Superhumans are visionaries 
Superhumans see the future in the way they would like it to be. That future is inclusive of all life. It's prosperous and full of wisdom, joy, blissfulness and peace. Superhumans live their lives to make their vision happen. They are always present in the now while they are doing it. 

## Superhumans are optimistic 
Future is bringing a better life than present. While living in present, superhumans look forward to the future. Knowing that they are helping create the future in a conscious way. Optimism enables superhumans to expand possibilities in future.

## Superhumans are progressive 
Future presence is one of superhuman practices. Being present in the now, with a clear future intent. Planting seeds with future trees in mind. This is progressive thinking. Always being ready to think a step ahead. Embrace the future, now. 

## Superhumans are resourceful 
Superhumans are able to make something out of nothing. Nothingness is the greatest platform for creation. A blank sheet of paper. Every resource is useful and matters. Superhumans are resourceful in the way the utilise resources to create. Superabundance does not waste. Superabundance is resourceful. 

## Superhumans are patient 
We know that time is a construct of human mind. Since creation takes an element of human mental activity, creation takes time. Gestation process for a baby is nine months. There's no need to rush the process. Patience is a virtue as such. Superhumans are patient across many projects they work on in parallel. 

## Superhumans are inclusive 
Exclusivity is the game of excluding. Inclusivity is the game of including. Every life matters and every life is includable. Superhumans find ways to include others. They don't find reasons to exclude others. Transcend and include. 

## Superhumans are light 
Enlightenment is the process of losing psychological weight. In that process, one starts shining brighter and brighter. Superhumans are light in weight and luminosity. They own this instead of avoiding it. 

## Superhumans are self-actualised 
Knowledge is power. Self knowledge a superpower. Knowing oneself is a pre-requisite for being able to do anything with integrity. It's a well guarded secret. You are it. Superhumans know this. They are self-actualised to be able to deal with anyone else with integrity.

## Superhumans are clear 
Clarity of mind is another superpower. Superhumans are clear of impurities of the mind. This clarity is a continuous, ever present starting points for every decision. Superhumans also make themselves clear about whatever they want. Clarity gets reflected in everything they do. 

## Superhumans are authentic 
Each superhuman is true to themselves. This is the authentic place from which to be, do and have everything. Being authentic is the true way to be. Superhumans embrace their authenticity as the ultimate differentiation and advantage. They embrace others' authenticity too. 

## Superhumans are wise 
Knowledge is power. Wisdom is forever knowledge, put into practice. Minute by minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly. Forever. Integration of wisdom of all ages gives superhumans more and more power over time. 

## Superhumans are artists of their own life 
Art of life is the reflection of Self in everything one does. Superhumans recognise, embrace and practice this all the time. Life is a miracle which expresses itself as a super high fidelity artwork at all times. Superhumans are conscious creators of this artwork.

## Superhumans want everything 
Superhumans can create everything from nothing. As nothing, they want everything. Why? Why not? It's our birthright. Superhumans don't need anything, they want everything. It's part of the art of life. Living a completely fulfilled life. 

## Superhumans are beyond super heroes
Super heroes inspired humanity back in 70s, 80s and 90s. They are no longer enough to keep us going. Superhumans are real world humans with extraordinary self realised abilities. Superpowers that are useful for us all. Superhumans bring us real world soulutions(1). Those soulutions enable humanity to make the essential leaps forward into superhumanity.

## Superhumans are fearless 
Superhumans are Tier 2 people on Spiral Dynamics model. They have transcended all fears and live a fearless life. This is because they know that fear stems from one thing. Self. As they have realised themselves, they know they have nothing to fear. The future they are entering into is a future they are creating. In a conscious way and with full intent. 

# Do

## Superhumans explore
Exploration is natural to superhumans. They are always on a quest to discover new things. To learn new knowledge. To integrate different aspects of themselves. And discover new parts of the planet and galaxy.

## Superhumans create
Superhumans are powerful creators who create all the time. They create across many realms of their multi-intelligent capability. It is normal for superhumans to paint, write poetry, design and code and write books. 

## Superhumans speak truth 
Superhumans understand that there are different types of truth. They speak their own truth in congruent, integral and holistic way. They are not afraid of speaking their truth. 

## Superhumans care 
The kind of care superhumans show is of practical nature. It is care that helps others improve and move forward. It's a solution based care. Not care that only listens without ability to act to improve and correct. Unless listening is the act of care. In which case superhumans listen with care. 

## Superhumans propagate aspirations
Aspiration is stronger and more powerful than desperation. Even a desperate person is aspiring to get out of desperation. Superhumans know this and embrace aspirations as normal way of living life. 'What now?' is a standard question superhumans ask themselves.  

## Superhumans connect
The first step is to connect with oneself. Each superhuman connects with themselves first. On the deepest possible level. From there on superhumans connect with others to grow and expand further. Starting from 'I', they move onto 'We' and then 'It' and 'Its' quadrants. 

## Superhumans evolve humanity 
Through self discovery, development and innerstanding, superhumans help evolve humanity. By setting new standards of best practice behaviours. By setting best in class ways of being. In the most literal sense. They leave examples of how to Be, Do and Have in a superhuman way. As superhuman Einstein said: 'The only way to teach is through an example.' 

## Superhumans design 
Design is the way things work. It is also applied philosophy. By having a comprehensive philosophy superhumans design how things can work. They set new standards. Create true innovations based on sound foundations of self knowledge. Superhumans design in sustainable and inclusive ways. 

## Superhumans thrive 
No matter what the circumstances, superhumans are able to thrive and create. They understand that their state determines circumstances. They don't let circumstances determine 
their state. This is how superhumans are able to make a positive difference no matter what is happening.

## Superhumans innovate
Superhuman innovation bases itself on soul and essence of what it means to be human. It is radical in the truest sense. Revolutionary as it comes from a super high realm of thinking. Thinking beyond thinking. Consciousness itself. Superhuman innovations are not based on ego. 

## Superhumans do what they love 
Wisdom, love and joy and integral part of superhuman way of being and living life. As such, superhumans life a joyful life and create from love. To be able to do so, they first live a life they love. It's the wisest way to be. 

## Superhumans create from a divine purpose 
Superhumans have direct connection to divine. They can hear their inner calling. They are able to accept this as the way to create in the purest sense. Purpose equals energy. Divine purpose equals super energy. 

## Superhumans learn 
Learning is an ongoing part of superhuman lifestyle. Learning about learning is too. Superhumans are thirsty for new knowledge and applied wisdom all the time. There is nothing hard about learning. It's the way to be and to improve. Always starting from self and then impacting on everything and everyone else.

## Superhumans manage complexity 
Complexity is part of the nature of the universe we live in. As such, it needs managing as opposed to simplifying. Superhumans are great managers of complexity through models, maps and frameworks. One of those models is atomic design and holonomic approach to systems. 

## Superhumans act fast
As soon as a realisation gets obtained, superhumans start putting it into practice. The notion of 'processing' is fast with superhumans. They are able to utilise all their sensory faculties to double and triple check things. As such, superhumans cut down processing time. Then act fast on new realisations. 

## Superhumans show up
Only death can stop superhumans from living their purpose. Since they are always doing what they love, they show up to things they promise to show up to. The only thing that can stop superhumans is death or comma. Everything else gets overcome one way or another. Even if showing up is via a virtual channel. 

## Superhumans consider many possibilities  
Everything is possible. Not everything is probable. Superhumans draw this distinction in their minds in a clear way. They consider many possibilities to explore the most optimal solutions for future. This way they are avoiding taking dead-end paths which need backing out of in future. 

## Superhumans lead 
Superhumans bring others along. They do this by showing by example and leading themselves first. They lead with integrity and congruence. Never promising what they can't deliver and always delivering what they promise. One way or another. Leadership is about being, doing and having in a integral way. 

## Superhumans inspire
Superhuman spirit is always present. As such, superhumans are always in spirit. They are inspired by their very nature. This is why superhumans inspire through everything they are, do and have. Inspiration from superhumans creates ongoing positive vibes around the world. It drives aspirations through inspiration. 

## Superhumans live clean 
Superhumans eat clean without consumption of alcohol, drugs, smoking and processed foods. Clarity of body goes hand in hand with keeping a clear mind. Superhumans live a clean life all round. They consume lots of water and breathe the right way.

## Superhumans understand
Superhumans understand many perspectives. They contemplate many points of view. They can hold opposing points of view at the same time. They synthesise perspectives to see more. They are able to infer and deduce. They can work knowledge out, not only read it from elsewhere. 

## Superhumans self develop
Continuous self develop is the norm for superhumans. It's not an addiction, but a practical way of existing. Self innovation is the starting point for any other type of innovation which is a derivative of self. 

## Superhumans live their values 
Knowledge is power. Knowledge of self is a superpower. Personal values are a guide. They reflect in everything superhumans do. Living one's values is the way to always bring value to the world. Life is valuable. One's own values add value to life and humanity. 

## Superhumans play
Superhumans have healthy inner child within them. They play all the time. It's the most optimal way to complete any game. Including the games of life and legacy building. Superhumans play even with the most serious of circumstances. 

## Superhumans perfect 
Continuous process of perfecting creates better circumstances. It is not perfectionism. It is perfecting. There is always a better way to do anything. Superhumans perfect better ways all the time. It is continuous innovation at the heart of approach to life. 

## Superhumans see reality for what it is 
Direct experiencing is the highest form of knowing reality. Seeing reality without any mental filters is truth. Superhumans see reality for what it is. Not for what they think it is. This purity of observation enables superhumans to be right more often. 

## Superhumans realise they are perfect
As Robert Anthony, PhD in psychology states: 'You are already perfect on the level of being.' Realising the perfection within is only the start. From a place of inner perfection, superhumans intend everything the do and have. This statement, although controversial to many, is freeing those those who accept it. Superhumans accept it. They make no excuses from there on.

## Superhumans make deals 
Deal making is an art. Superhumans are artists. As such, they are also deal makers. Capitalist, socialist, anarchist, anarcho-capitalist or whatever system, superhumans make deals within it. The first deal is to deal with oneself. Every other deal from there on is integral to superhuman nature. 

# Have

## Superhumans have integrity 
Everything superhumans are, do and have is harmonious. Psychological congruence is the way they are. Integrity is a need, not an achievement. Creation of legacy requires integrity. Integrity is the base upon everything else gets developed in a reliable way. Integrity is what all super achievers of the times past had. 

## Superhumans have Fresh Minds
Purity and focus of mind are essential to create and maintain a superhuman life. And to leave a superhuman impact after life. Fresh Mind is available to everyone who is willing to make a giant leap into superhumanity. It is a tried, tested and reliable process that gets humans to become superhumans. In an enjoyable and experiential way.  

## Superhumans have a vision
Vision guides superhumans towards creating a better life for themselves and everyone else. The vision is holistic and very long term in nature. It is normal for superhumans to think of 10, 20 and 30+ years ahead. And to handle those time scales with ease and flow.
