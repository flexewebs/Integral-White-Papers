# Be

## Superhumans are superabundant
At any stage in their lives, superhumans know they live in superabundace. They are aware of direct access to resources. Their superabundance starts in the mind. It reflects in doing and having. In that order. Superhuman abundant physical life is a direct results of mental superabundance.

## Superhumans are polymaths
Interest in many subjects is the norm for superhumans. They synthesise across varied realms. They aim to realise broader truth. They embrace tendency to like many themes. They utilise plethora of different skills. They always work on expanding their capabilities across the board.

## Superhumans are neutral
Inner balance is the most natural state of being. Superhumans realise this and keep their inner balance at all times. From this state they can do and have balanced outcomes in life. Outcomes which have long term relevance. 

## Superhumans are blissful 
Blissfulness is a byproduct of enlightenment. Realising the perfection of creation produces blissfulness in all situations. Superhumans are blissful because of the awareness level they are at. 

## Superhumans are complete
Superhumans feel complete inside. They don't need anything. They are able to survive no matter what. They still upgrade their approach to life. They know their potential. They use time to realise that potential. 

## Superhumans are prophetic 
Superhumans know that words create worlds. They are care-full about what they speak into reality. What superhumans talk about, becomes reality.  Superhuman approach to life means that their verbal predictions become prophetic. This is because superhumans put their own words into practice.

## Superhumans know
Superhumans gain knowledge all the time. Knowledge is power. Continuous gaining of knowledge is a continuous gaining of power. Superhumans first know themselves. They then integrate all kinds of other knowledge throughout their lives. They also share their knowledge with the rest of humanity. 

## Superhumans prioritise doing over talking 
Words create worlds. It requires doing for verbal intentions to reflect themselves in reality. This is why superhumans prioritise doing over talking. Reflections in reality are more valuable than conceptions in language. 

## Superhumans are strategic
Long term approach is the key to being superhuman. Ten, twenty, thirty or hundred year visions and plans are normal. You can only connect the dots backwards. Start with the end vision. Then connect the dots backwards to present moment. Then act on the outlined strategy. 

## Superhumans are systematic
A complete approach to life and understanding of how things work is a requisite. Superhumans understand the systemic nature of everything. They are systems thinkers and comprehend complexity very well. They are able to design and change systems for the better. 

## Superhumans are peaceful 
Inner peace produces peace on Earth. Superhumans understand that peace is the most natural way to be. Superhumans are always peaceful. Even if that peacefulness requires them to self-protect. Superhumans will never start a fight first. This is in line with teachings and ethos of all martial arts. 

## Superhumans are visionaries 
Superhumans see the future in the way they would like it to be. That future is inclusive of all life. It's prosperous and full of wisdom, joy, blissfulness and peace. Superhumans live their lives to make their vision happen. They are always present in the now while they are doing it.

## Superhumans are resourceful 
Superhumans are able to make something out of nothing. Nothingness is the greatest platform for creation. A blank sheet of paper. Every resource is useful and matters. Superhumans are resourceful in the way the utilise resources to create. Superabundance does not waste. Superabundance is resourceful. 

## Superhumans are patient 
We know that time is a construct of human mind. Since creation takes an element of human mental activity, creation takes time. Gestation process for a baby is nine months. There's no need to rush the process. Patience is a virtue as such. Superhumans are patient across many projects they work on in parallel. 

## Superhumans are inclusive 
Exclusivity is the game of excluding. Inclusivity is the game of including. Every life matters and every life is includable. Superhumans find ways to include others. They don't find reasons to exclude others. Transcend and include. 

## Superhumans are light 
Enlightenment is the process of losing psychological weight. In that process, one starts shining brighter and brighter. Superhumans are light in weight and luminosity. They own this instead of avoiding it. 

## Superhumans are self-actualised 
Knowledge is power. Self knowledge a superpower. Knowing oneself is a pre-requisite for being able to do anything with integrity. It's a well guarded secret. You are it. Superhumans know this. They are self-actualised to be able to deal with anyone else with integrity.

## Superhumans are clear 
Clarity of mind is another superpower. Superhumans are clear of impurities of the mind. This clarity is a continuous, ever present starting points for every decision. Superhumans also make themselves clear about whatever they want. Clarity gets reflected in everything they do. 

## Superhumans are authentic 
Each superhuman is true to themselves. This is the authentic place from which to be, do and have everything. Being authentic is the true way to be. Superhumans embrace their authenticity as the ultimate differentiation and advantage. They embrace others' authenticity too. 

## Superhumans are wise 
Knowledge is power. Wisdom is forever knowledge, put into practice. Minute by minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly. Forever. Integration of wisdom of all ages gives superhumans more and more power over time. 

## Superhumans are artists of their own life 
Art of life is the reflection of Self in everything one does. Superhumans recognise, embrace and practice this all the time. Life is a miracle which expresses itself as a super high fidelity artwork at all times. Superhumans are conscious creators of this artwork.

## Superhumans want everything 
Superhumans can create everything from nothing. As nothing, they want everything. Why? Why not? It's our birthright. Superhumans don't need anything, they want everything. It's part of the art of life. Living a completely fulfilled life. 

## Superhumans are beyond super heroes
Super heroes inspired humanity back in 70s, 80s and 90s. They are no longer enough to keep us going. Superhumans are real world humans with extraordinary self realised abilities.
